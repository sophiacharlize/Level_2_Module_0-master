  //  if you are using Processing 3, you cannot use variables
  //  because the developers don't know how programming is supposed to work.

  //3. initialize your array with the built in width variable
  
  //4. initialize the ints in the array with random numbers
  //   from 0 to the built in height variable

  //5. call the noStroke() method

  //7. set the color for your graph

  //8. draw a rectangle for each int in your array.
  //   the x value will be the element of the int
  //   the y value will the height variable
  //   the width is 1
  //   the height is negative the value of the int at that element in the array


  //9. call the stepSort method

  //10. extract the code that randomizes the array into a method.

  //11. call the method you made in step 10 when the mouse is pressed
